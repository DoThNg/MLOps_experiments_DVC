## MLOps and ML Pipeline Experiments
This is a repo for MLOps and ML pipeline experiments and practices using DVC and other tech stack :star: :star: :star:

1. [ML pipeline with DVC](https://github.com/DoThNg/MLOps_experiments_DVC/tree/main/1_ML_Pipeline_DVC): This is an experiment of building a simple and reproducible ML pipeline, using DVC at local machine. 
2. [ML pipeline with DVC, MLFlow and Dagster](https://github.com/DoThNg/MLOps_experiments_DVC/tree/main/2_ML_Pipeline_DVC_MLflow): An experiment of developing a ML pipeline, enabled by data versioning (DVC), ML experiment tracking (MLFlow) and workflow orchestration (Dagster)
3. [ML Pipeline with DVC, PyCaret, MLflow and Dagster](https://github.com/DoThNg/MLOps_experiments_DVC/tree/main/3_ML_Pipeline_DVC_PyCaret): An extended version of experiment #2 with additional element of auto-ML (Pycaret) in training and evaluation.
